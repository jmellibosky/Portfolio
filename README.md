# Joaqu√≠n Mellibosky's Personal Portfolio
Welcome to my personal portfolio. In this project you will get a grasp of my personal background, my skills, and some of the personal projects I've worked on.

## Technologies
This portfolio is developed with React.js, on top of the basic web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS). I've also added Bootstrap and SASS in order to simplify the styling process and to develop a responsive and user-friendly website.
